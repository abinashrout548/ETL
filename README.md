# Student ETL Pipeline with Scheduling

This project implements a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for student data using Python. It reads student data from a CSV file, processes it to determine pass/fail status and grades, saves the results to new CSV files, and loads the data into an SQLite database. The ETL job is scheduled to run automatically every day at 2:10 AM.
